## Overview

This repository contains **RIP-001: Updated Structure Reformation and Governance Improvement Proposal**, a framework designed to improve the governance and operational efficiency of **RomeDAO** and its ecosystem. The proposal outlines strategies to address governance vulnerabilities, empower sub-DAOs, and enhance community-led decision-making within the **Houses of Rome**.

### Background

This proposal emerged in response to critical challenges faced by RomeDAO, including:
- A malicious **FDV (Fully Diluted Value)** attack that exploited governance mechanisms, leading to a raid on the treasury.
- A **hostile takeover** that resulted in the dissolution of the treasury and a collapse in community morale.
- The broader disarray and demoralization of the community following the attack.

Despite its comprehensive vision for reform, **RIP-001** was never implemented. The DAO's fractured state post-attack hindered efforts to organize around the proposed changes, leaving the reform unrealized.

### Vision

The proposal aimed to:
- Reinforce governance structures to prevent similar attacks.
- Empower sub-DAOs (Houses) to formulate, debate, and present proposals effectively.
- Establish clear roles for the **Senate** and its members as facilitators of DAO-wide decision-making.
- Create the **Bank of Rome** sub-DAO to manage treasury operations independently and transparently.

## Key Features

- **In-House Governance:** A system allowing sub-DAOs (Houses) to discuss and vote on proposals internally before Senate review.
- **Senate Reform:** Redefining the role of Senators as representatives who champion their Houseâ€™s proposals at the Senate level.
- **Treasury Management:** Creation of the **Bank of Rome** sub-DAO to oversee and safeguard treasury resources.
- **Formalized Proposal Path:** A structured process from ideation to Senate hearings and Snapshot voting.
- **Community Empowerment:** Clear channels for citizen participation in proposal discussions and decisions.

## Lessons Learned

The history surrounding **RIP-001** highlights the importance of robust DAO governance. The events following the treasury raid demonstrated:
- The need for proactive measures to mitigate governance-based attacks.
- The critical role of community cohesion in DAO survival and resilience.
- The perils of governance vulnerability and the high cost of organizational disarray.
